Title: Analysing factors influencing mental health among individuals: Machine Learning Approach

Mental health is a crucial aspect of our daily lives, and itâ€™s essential to prioritize our well-being, even amidst the demands of a busy lifestyle that can negatively impact our mental state. To address this issue, a mental health dataset sourced from Kaggle, which includes responses from 147,000 participants, was analyzed. This dataset captures a range of factors affecting mental health through numerical and categorical data. To further explore this topic, four key questions were proposed to guide the analysis.

1. Association between dietary habits and mental health (i.e. depression, suicidal thoughts, Family history of Mental Illness)
2. Analyze the relationship between sleep duration and academic performance (i.e. Academic Pressure, CGPA, Study hours) 
3. Analyze how work pressure affects job satisfaction among different working professionals (i.e. Profession, Job Satisfaction, Financial Stress, Work hours)
4. Comparison of different machine learning models for predicting Depression

# Key Findings
Result 1.


Result 4.
Divided our predictive analysis into 2 groups
- Students
- Working Adults

Used 5 models to find the best model in predicting depression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)

=> Worker model: All models performed above 90% with the best model being SVM and Logistic Regression (Both metrics evaluation being the same)

=> Student model: All models performed poorer than the Worker model, with the best model being SVM (All above 80% except decision tree)

* One possible reason for the poor model performance is class imbalance, as working adults had more data compared to students
