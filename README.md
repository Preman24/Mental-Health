# Mental Health Project-Description

Mental health is a crucial aspect of our daily lives, and itâ€™s essential to prioritize our well-being, even amidst the demands of a busy lifestyle that can negatively impact our mental state. To address this issue, we analyzed a mental health dataset sourced from Kaggle, which includes responses from 147,000 participants. This dataset captures a range of factors affecting mental health through numerical and categorical data. To further explore this topic, we proposed four key questions to guide our analysis.

1. Association between dietary habits and mental health (i.e. depression, suicidal thoughts, Family history of Mental Illness)
2. Analyze the relationship between sleep duration and academic performance (i.e. Academic Pressure, CGPA, Study hours) 
3. Analyze how work pressure affects job satisfaction among different working professionals (i.e. Profession, Job Satisfaction, Financial Stress, Work hours)
4. Comparision of different machine learning models for predicting Depression
