# Project-Description

As Mental Health is a crucial aspect of our daily lives, it is important to take care of ourselves despite living a busy life which may potentially harm our mental health. To tackle this issue, a mental health dataset was retrieved from Kaggle to analyze how and what can affect our mental health. The dataset is based on mental health and consists of 147,000 participants who answered different questions and their answers are in numerical and categorical values. Hence, 4 questions were proposed to answer this topic:

1. Association between dietary habits and mental health (i.e. depression, suicidal thoughts, Family history of Mental Illness)
2. Analyze the relationship between sleep duration and academic performance (i.e. Academic Pressure, CGPA, Study hours) 
3. Analyze how work pressure affects job satisfaction among different working professionals (i.e. Profession, Job Satisfaction, Financial Stress, Work hours)
4. Comparision of different machine learning models for predicting Depression
